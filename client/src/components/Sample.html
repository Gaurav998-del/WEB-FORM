    Create React Head & Tail page, you need to add one dropdown & one submit button. Here you need to implement a logic for head & tail. First of all, you need to add two values in the dropdown 'H'  & 'T'  and by default, there will be the text “select value” as a placeholder (if you haven't selected anything). Select any value from the dropdown (H or T) and click on submit button. Now suppose you choose H value (it should be visible below submit button) and now if you add two more times H then those 2 H chars should be visible below the first H. Now If you select T then It should be visible beside First H, and if you again add T then it should be visible below the first T. Now if you add H then it should be visible beside the first T, and If you again add T then It should be visible beside H.Now if you add H then it should be visible beside the first T, and If you again add T then It should be visible beside H. Now at last if you again add T then it should be visible below the first T H T H T. All you need to do is make separate columns for H and T, if you add same char then it will visible below that added char, if you add a new then we'll create a new column. Put a validation in submit button, if you have not selected H or T then there should be one validation message like "Please select value from the dropdown". Once you select any value from the dropdown and click on submit button, the dropdown should reset to the default value.
